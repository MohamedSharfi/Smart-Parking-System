# Smart Parking System 

A simple Smart Parking System developed as part of a university assignment. This project was implemented using both **C** and **Assembly Language**, running on an **ATmega328A** microcontroller.

## Project Overview

This system simulates a parking lot that detects vehicles entering and exiting using IR sensors. It tracks and displays the number of available parking slots using a four-digit seven-segment display, and uses LEDs to indicate parking availability.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller**: ATmega328A  
- **Display**: 4 x Seven-Segment Display  
- **Sensors**: 2 x IR Digital Sensors  
- **Indicators**: 2 x LED Indicators  

##  Programming Languages

- [✔️ C Language Implementation](src/mainc.c)  
- [⚙️ Assembly Language Implementation](src/Mainassembly.txt)

## Features

- IR-based vehicle detection.
- Real-time slot counter.
- Visual status indication with LEDs.
- Dual-language code (C and Assembly) for educational purpose.
